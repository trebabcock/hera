# Hera

Hera is a simple game engine for .NET Core. It uses OpenTK for graphics and input. It's pretty useless right now, it has the very beginnings of an entity component system, and that's pretty much it. I'll be working on it pretty regulary though, so feel free to check back soon, or submit a PR if you want to contribute.
